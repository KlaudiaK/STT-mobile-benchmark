237-134500-0034  THANK YOU HE RETURNED SHORTLY
260-123286-0002  O MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEEDED TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING OUT OF HIM BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL HIS NATURE HAS RESUMED ITS WAY
260-123286-0012  BUT THERE SEEMED NO REASON OF FEAR
260-123286-0029  THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTACK EACH OTHER WITH THE GREATEST ANIMOSITY
260-123288-0012  WILL BE THE SAFEST NO NO NEVER
260-123440-0019  CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED
672-122797-0000  OUT IN THE WOOD STOOD A NICE LITTLE FIR TREE
672-122797-0011  AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS THEN
672-122797-0025  THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
672-122797-0036  HUMPY DON'T BEFELL DOWNSTAIRS AND YET HE MARRIED THE PRINCESS
672-122797-0053  THEY WERE SO EXTREMELY CURIOUS
672-122797-0054  I KNOW NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE TREE
672-122797-0072  AND THE GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP LYING THERE
908-31957-0011  AND LOVE BE FALSE
908-157963-0005  LIKE THE DOVES BOYS LIKE TRANSIENT DAY LIKE MUSIC IN THE AIR AH
908-157963-0023  THE HELPLESS WORM AROSE AND SAT UPON THE LILY'S LEAF IN THE BRIGHT CLOUD SAILED ON TO FIND HIS PARTNER IN THE VALE
1089-134686-0010  WELL NOW EDIS I DECLARE YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK
1089-134686-0012  HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOLINESS A STRANGE LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER
1089-134691-0001  FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1089-134691-0008  THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TOO BY TWO STAINED YELLOW OR RED OR LIVID BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE
1089-134691-0020  HALLO STUFFANOS HERE COMES THE DAEDALUS
1188-133604-0026  HERE'S AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATSOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APOLLO IN THE PYTHON
1188-133604-0029  ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD IN FAR
1188-133604-0033  EVERY PLANT IN THE GRASS IS SET FORMERLY GROWS PERFECTLY IT MAY BE REALIZED COMPLETELY
1188-133604-0035  THUS IN CHAUCER'S DREAM
1188-133604-0038  BUT NOW HERE IS A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNER DREW IT AT ALL
1221-135766-0008  MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
1221-135767-0001  ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
1221-135767-0009  A PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
1221-135767-0020  IN TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT AFFORD
1284-1180-0002  INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS TURN OVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAIN
1284-1180-0007  HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THERE NEAREST NEIGHBOUR
1284-1180-0017  AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
1284-1180-0020  THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS HAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
1284-1180-0027  YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EAT BATTERY AS LOVE
1284-1180-0029  SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLORS ARE SO MIXED UP
1284-1181-0017  THE WIZARD OF OZ WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG AND KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND UNTOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE'S MERELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORCERESS
1320-122612-0002  AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAWKEYE WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL
1320-122612-0003  HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A RIVULET WITHOUT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY OF VELOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS
1320-122617-0003  THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS AIR AND MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
1320-122617-0008  THE YOUNG MAN IS IN BONDAGE AND MUCH I FEAR HIS DEATH IS DECREED
1320-122617-0009  I GREATLY MOURN THAT ONE SO WELL DISPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE AND I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HYMN CAN YOU LEAD ME TO HIM
1320-122617-0015  BUT THE BEAR INSTEAD OF OBEYING MAINTAIN OF THE SEAT IT HAD TAKEN AND GROWLED
1320-122617-0022  THE DELAWARES ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTOISE AND THEY OUTSTRIPPED THE DEER
1320-122617-0027  AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS
1320-122617-0029  IF YOU ARE NOT THEN KNOCKED ON THE HEAD YOUR BEING A NONCOMPOSTER WILL PROTECT YOU AND YOU'LL THEN HAVE A GOOD REASON TO EXPECT TO DIE IN YOUR BED
1320-122617-0033  IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SCALP AS I TRUST AND BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND ON IT UNCAS AND I WILL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT AS BECOMES TRUE WARRIORS AND TRUSTY FRIENDS
1580-141083-0002  MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS AT BAKER STREET
1580-141083-0009  THEY'LL TURN OUT WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
1580-141083-0014  TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
1580-141083-0038  I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THE STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
1580-141084-0000  IT WAS THE INDIAN WHOSE DARK SILHOUETTE APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON HIS BLIND
1580-141084-0004  OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS KNOCKING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTEOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS
1580-141084-0029  HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANISTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER
1995-1826-0000  THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIOR SOCIETIES HER DEFENCE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM
1995-1826-0014  HARDEN SHE PAUSED
1995-1826-0017  THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE
1995-1836-0001  GLASS THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AND ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SENATE
1995-1836-0002  I SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHER MEN
1995-1837-0000  HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE HE IS IN ZARAS MUST BE RUINED
1995-1837-0007  THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MIDDAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE LOOSE STEEL BATTERY IS LOW
2094-142345-0011  DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY A FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WHILE SHAPENED LIGHTFOOTED
2094-142345-0019  COMB THE WOOL FOR THE WIDOWS INDEED
2094-142345-0029  DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
2094-142345-0039  I STRUNG ASSURANCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN FROM ANYTHING I HAVE DONE
2094-142345-0047  POYSER IS NOT AT HOME IS HE
2094-142345-0060  OH I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPITAL ORDER
2300-131720-0011  BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS ARE REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARM HOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL
2300-131720-0031  ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE
2830-3979-0012  THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOR EVER
2830-3980-0025  BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
2830-3980-0036  WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST REIGNS THERE
2830-3980-0037  SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE THREE
2830-3980-0041  GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0047  TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY
2830-3980-0073  THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES INTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SIN
2961-960-0001  INFLUENCE WHICH TIMAS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
2961-960-0004  THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TENEAS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEOPLATINISTS
2961-960-0011  WITH HERAGLETUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE AN EXAGGERIST HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING BY THE FEDERIANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
2961-960-0018  BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
2961-961-0006  IN WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POET SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK
2961-961-0015  MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME
3570-5694-0008  THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
3570-5695-0001  A DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST ELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PEASANTS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUAL IN ARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST
3570-5696-0002  OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOUR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
3570-5696-0006  AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERY DAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRECATION
3570-5696-0008  BUT IT IS ANOTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TIME WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERY DAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED HAS WASTEFUL
3570-5696-0009  IN STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON
3575-170457-0015  BUT DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I DISPARAGE THE GIFT WHICH YOU POSSESS NOR THAT I WOULD DISCOURAGE YOU FROM EXERCISING IT I ONLY EXHORT YOU SO TO THINK OF IT AND SO TO USE IT AS TO RENDER IT CONDUCIVE TO YOUR OWN PERMANENT GOOD
3575-170457-0023  I CAREFULLY AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PREOCCUPATION AND ACCENTRICITY WHICH MIGHT LEAD THOSE I LIVE AMONGST TO SUSPECT THE NATURE OF MY PURSUITS
3575-170457-0034  IN THIS MONOTONOUS LIFE OF MIND THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
3729-6852-0010  I NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY
3729-6852-0022  I ADDRESS HIM AN ITALIAN AND HE ANSWERS VERY WITTILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
3729-6852-0023  REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVE TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT WRITER
3729-6852-0040  OR THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU WILL MAKE RAPID PROGRESS
4077-13751-0001  ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AN INSIGNIFICANT SEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITION
4077-13754-0010  IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS UNACTED WITH THE PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING POOR MARRIAGE AND AS I'VE BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SENATE PRAYER TO ITS PASSAGE IT LAY FOR MANY YEARS A DEAD LETTER
4446-2273-0002  LAMB WOULDN'T CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT MANY OF THEM I FANCY
4446-2273-0016  HER HAIR IS STILL LIKE FLAX AND HER BLUE EYES ARE JUST LIKE A BABY'S AND SHE HAS THE SAME THREE FRECKLES ON HER LITTLE NOSE AND TALKS ABOUT GOING BACK TO HER BANDOMER
4446-2273-0021  WHAT SHE WANTED FROM US WAS NEITHER OUR FLOWERS NOR OUR FRANKS BUT JUST OUR YOUTH
4446-2273-0022  BUT BOTH REMEMBERING WHAT THE WOMAN HAD SAID WHEN SHE TOOK THE MONEY GOD GIVE YOU A HAPPY LOVE
4446-2275-0007  SHE PUSHED HIM TOWARD THE BIG CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEARTH HER KNEES DRAWN UP TO HER CHIN LAUGHING LIKE A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL
4446-2275-0031  I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG
4507-16021-0042  IT IS BLACK AND MISFORTUNE IT IS AS BLACK OR STILL AND CRIME THESE TWO BLACKNESSES A MALAGAMATED COMPOSLANG
4507-16021-0047  YESTERDAY WE'RE TREMBLING FOR A HEALTH THAT IS DEAR TO YOU TO DAY YOU FEAR FOR YOUR OWN TO MORROW IT WILL BE ANXIETY ABOUT MONEY THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE DIET TRIBE OF A SLANDERER THE DAY AFTER THAT THE MISFORTUNE OF SOME FRIEND THEN THE PREVAILING WEATHER THEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN OR LOST THIN A PLEASURE WITH WHICH YOUR CONSCIENCE AND YOUR VERTERBRAL COLUMN REPROACH YOU AGAIN THE COURSE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
4970-29095-0028  HE DOESN'T SAY BUT IT'S ON THE FRONTIER AND ON THE MAP EVERYTHING BEYOND IT IS MARKED INDIANS AND DESERT AND LOOKS AS DESOLATE AS A WEDSAY MEETING IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO DO SOMETHING
4992-41797-0003  MISTER POPHAM LAID DOWN HIS BRUSH
4992-41797-0014  WHEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE A RABBIT OR A BIRD LOOK REAL ON PAPER SHE SEARCHED IN HER FATHER'S BOOKS FOR PICTURES OF ITS BONES
4992-41806-0004  BURN FIRE BURN FLICKER FLICKER FLAME
5105-28233-0006  NO CATHEDRAL NOT EVEN BURGOS ITSELF COULD VIE WITH THE CHURCH AT MONT MARTRA
5105-28241-0000 CY GOING QUALITIES WERE EXCELLENT AND WOULD HAVE AMPLY SUFFICED FOR A CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF THE GLOBE
5105-28241-0005  FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST OF ALGERIA BUT NO LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH
5105-28241-0009  AND WHAT DEMONSTRATION DO YOU OFFER ASKED SERVADAC EAGERLY THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN
5105-28241-0010  OCEAN RAINED SUPREME
5142-36586-0000  IT IS MANIFEST THAT MAN IS NOW SUBJECT TO MUCH VARIABILITY
5639-40744-0012  SHE SUCCEEDED IN OPENING THE WINDOW AND THE MOONLIGHT SHONE IN SO BRIGHTLY AS SHE COULD DISTINGUISH THE COLOR OF SOME DAMASK HANGING IN THE ROOM
5639-40744-0020  A STICKLY HUMANE AND RIGHT MINDED FATHER COMFORT HIS UNHAPPY DAUGHTER AND HER MOTHER EMBRACING HER AGAIN DID ALL SHE COULD TO SOOTHE THE FEELINGS
5639-40744-0033  BEARING WAS GRACEFUL AND ANIMATED SHE LED HER SON BY THE HAND AND BEFORE HER WALKED TWO MAIDS WITH WAX LIGHTS AND SILVER CANDLESTICKS
5683-32865-0005  BUT HOW GREETING TO CAPTAIN LAKE WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE
5683-32865-0013  DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HE'LL SOON TIRE OF COUNTRY LIFE
5683-32879-0000  IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PAST ELEVEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PONY CARRIAGE FROM BRANDON DREW UP BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN WICKET OF REDMAN'S FARM
5683-32879-0009  ILL AND TROUBLE DEAR TROUBLED IN MIND AND MISERABLY NERVOUS
5683-32879-0016  AND THE WAN ORACLE HAVING SPOKEN SHE SAT DOWN IN THE SAME SORT OF ABSTRACTION AGAIN BESIDE DORCAS AND SHE LOOKED FULL IN HER COUSIN'S EYES
5683-32879-0019  I HAVE VERY FEW TO LOVE ME NOW AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LOVE ME AS I HAVE BEGUN TO LOVE YOU
5683-32879-0021 RCAS IN HER STRANGE WAY WAS MOVED
6829-68769-0001  IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM IN THE STATE'S PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
6829-68769-0006  IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORT CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
6829-68771-0013  ATTENDANCE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FOR SEEING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR FIGHT
6829-68771-0019  SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MAIDS AT ELMHURST A PLAIN BLACK GALE WITH A WHITE APRON AND CAP
6930-75918-0016  YES I NEED REPOSE MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TO DAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURN TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN
6930-76324-0000  GOLIATH MAKES ANOTHER DISCOVERY
6930-76324-0001  IT WAS CERTAINLY NO NEAR THE SOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM
6930-76324-0023  MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVEN'T ANY LEFT AS USUAL
6930-81414-0026  MY OVERWROUGHT NERVES YIELDED AT LAST
7021-79740-0000  TO SUCH A PERSON THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
7021-79740-0001  BLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
7021-79759-0002  THEIR CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
7021-85628-0009  AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS
7021-85628-0018  IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
7021-85628-0026  NO MY LITTLE FUND SHE SAID
7127-75946-0012  THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING DURING ITS PROGRESS IT KINDLED EVERY VARIETY OF COQUETRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
7127-75947-0004  EXPLAIN YOURSELF
7127-75947-0015  I CANNOT BE A DOUBT HE RECEIVED YOU KINDLY FOR IN FACT YOU RETURNED WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION
7176-88083-0000  ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN COLOR SCATTERED IN BROAD SPLASHES
7176-88083-0009  THE GREAT HAWK FOLLOWED HURRIEDLY TO RETRIEVE HIS PREY FROM THE GROUND
7176-92135-0006  I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND BUT PERHAPS BETTER KEEP THE PLOT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT
7176-92135-0012  INDEED IT RESOLUTION MADE THE KEYNOTE OF HELEN'S TOLOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE BEHOLD THIRTY LINES BY A SILAGE WORKING OF THE JOB BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATIST'S MEANING
7176-92135-0015  AND SO ON TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHEN OBELIA MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NON COMMITTAL OF THAT SORT
7176-92135-0023  YOU GAVE ME DOUBLE FIVE I WANT DOUBLE NINE HELLO IS THAT YOU HORATIO HAMLET SPEAKING
7176-92135-0038  A SAGE MEAL IS POPULAR BECAUSE IT PROVED TO THE AUDIENCE THAT THE ACCURATE EVEN WHEN CALLED CHARLES HALTREE OR OWENAIRES ARE REAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU AND ME
7729-102255-0004  PRIEST STATE MEN HAD ONLY THEIR CONVICTIONS THEIR INTELLIGENCE OR COURAGE AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF THE NORTH THE CONSPIRACY HAD ITS SECRET COMBINATION THE TERRITORIAL OFFICIALS THE LEGISLATURE THE BOGUS LAWS THE COURTS THE MILITIA OFFICERS THE PRESIDENT AND THE ARMY
7729-102255-0044  HARRY WAS PLACED IN THE CUSTODY OF CAPTAIN MARTIN OF THE KAPOO RANGERS WHO PROVED A KIND JAILER IMMATERIALLY ASSISTED IN PROTECTING HIM FROM THE DANGEROUS INTENTIONS OF THE MOB WHICH AT THAT TIME HELD LEVIN WORTH UNDER THE REIGN OF TERROR
8455-210777-0001  AT EVEN CROSSWELLER NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK BEEN STILL A COLLEGE HAD SIR KENNINGTON OVAL REMAINED IN ENGLAND AND MISTER BONNET AND THE BAR KEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ARRANGING FOR THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF MY OLD FRIEND
8455-210777-0016  THIS I FELT WAS PAID TO ME OF BEING PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND I ENDEAVOURED TO BEHAVE MYSELF WITH SUCH MINGLED HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BE FIT THE OCCASION BUT I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY ORDINARY LIFE
8455-210777-0044  I WAS TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND CARRIED TO ENGLAND OR ELSEWHERE OR DROWNED UPON THE VOYAGE A MATTER NOT WHICH
8455-210777-0047  YOU PROPOSE TO KIDNAP ME I SAID
8455-210777-0048  WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOUR GUN WERE I TO KIN UP YOU
8455-210777-0059  BUT IT IS SURMISED THAT YOU WILL FIND DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF YOUR ENTERING AT ONCE UPON YOUR GOVERNOR
8463-294825-0008  I FETCH OF THE NOVEL'S BREADING POWER COMES FROM CAPTAIN NEMO
8463-294825-0012  THE NAUTILUS NEARLY PERISHES IN THE ANTARCTIC AND NEMO SAINTS INTO ECHOING DEPRESSION
8463-294828-0000  CAPTA THREE AS MASTER WISHES
8463-294828-0001  THREE SECONDS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF J B HOBSON'S LETTER I KNOW MORE DREAMED OF CHASING THE UNICORN THAN OF TRYING FOR THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE
