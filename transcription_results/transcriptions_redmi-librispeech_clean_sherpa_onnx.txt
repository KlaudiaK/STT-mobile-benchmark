121-121726-0005 
121-127105-0019 N HOWEVER EXPRESSED A NEED FOR A LITTLE MORE LIGHT
121-127105-0021  YOU DULL DOUGLAS
237-126133-0002  AND HERE SAID MISSUS WINNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
237-126133-0006  AT THIS THE BUNDLE OPENED SUDDENLY AND OUT POPPED PHRONSIE
237-134493-0001  HIS WIFE NOW EYES BESIDE HIM AND THE WHITE SHAFT THAT MARKS THEIR GRAVES GLEAMS ACROSS THE WHEAT FIELDS
237-134493-0011  HOW BROWN YOU'VE GOT SINCE YOU CAME HOME I WISH I HAD AN ATHLETE TO MOW MY ORCHARD
237-134500-0002  A BRACE WIND HAD COME UP AND WAS DRIVING PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
237-134500-0006  JUST SMELL THE WILD RIVERS THEY ARE ALWAYS SO SPICY AFTER A RAIN
237-134500-0028  I AM SURE I EXAGGER HOPE YOU WILL STAY ON HERE SHE MURMURED
237-134500-0034  THANK YOU HE RETURNED SHORTLY
260-123286-0002  O MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEEDED TO STRUCK A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING OUT OF YOU BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL HIS NATURE HAS RESUMED ITS WAY
260-123286-0012  BUT THERE SEEMED NO REASON OF FEAR
260-123286-0029  THOSE HUGE CREATURE'S ATTACK EACH OTHER WITH THE GREATEST ANIMOSITY
260-123288-0012  WILL BE THE SAFEST NO NO NEVER
260-123440-0019  CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUNT WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED
672-122797-0000  OUT IN THE WOOD STOOD A NICE LITTLE FIR TREE
672-122797-0011  AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS THEN
672-122797-0025  SHE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
672-122797-0036  HUMBY DON'T BE FAIL DOWNSTAIRS AND YET HE MARRIED THE PRINCESS
672-122797-0053  THEY WERE SO EXTREMELY CURIOUS
672-122797-0054  I KNOW NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE TREE
672-122797-0072  AND THE GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP LYING THERE
908-31957-0011  AND LOVE BE FALSE
908-157963-0005  LIKE THE DOVE'S VOICE LIKE TRANSIENT DAY LIKE MUSIC IN THE AIR AH
908-157963-0023  THE HELPLESS WORM AROSE AND SAT UPON THE LILY'S LEAF AND THE BRIGHT CLOUD SAILS TO FIND HIS PARTNER IN THE BALE
1089-134686-0010  WELL NOW IN US I DECLARE YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK
1089-134686-0012  HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOLINESS A STRANGE LIGHT BLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER
1089-134691-0001  FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1089-134691-0008  THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TWO BY TWO STAINED YELLOW OR RED OR LIVID BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE
1089-134691-0020  HELLO STEPHANOS HERE COMES DAEDALUS
1188-133604-0026  HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T NOTICE THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND LOOK CARE FOR COLOR WHATSOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELLOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APOLLO IN THE PYTHON
1188-133604-0029  ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD IN FIRE
1188-133604-0033  EVERY PLANT IN THE GRASS IS SET FORMALLY GROWS PERFECTLY AND MAY BE REALIZED COMPLETELY
1188-133604-0035  THUS IN CHAUCER'S DREAM
1188-133604-0038  BUT NOW HERE IS A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHAT TURNER DREW IT AT ALL
1221-135766-0008  MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
1221-135767-0001  ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
1221-135767-0009  A PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
1221-135767-0020  IN TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
1284-1180-0002  INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURN OVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID
1284-1180-0007  HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THERE NEAREST NEIGHBOR
1284-1180-0017  AND ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FEDLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
1284-1180-0020  THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS HAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
1284-1180-0027  YET THAT ASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
1284-1180-0029  SOMETIME IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLORS ARE SO MIXED UP
1284-1181-0017  THE WIZARD OF OZ WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG AND KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND I'M TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE IS NEARLY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORCERESS
1320-122612-0002  AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAWKEYE WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL
1320-122612-0003  HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A RIVULET WITHOUT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS
1320-122617-0003  THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS AIR AND MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
1320-122617-0008  THE YOUNG MAN IS IN BONDAGE AND MUCH I FEAR HIS DEATH DECREED
1320-122617-0009  I GREATLY MOURN AT ONE SO WELL DISPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE THAT I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HYMN CAN YOU LEAD ME TO HIM
1320-122617-0015  BUT THE BEAR INSTEAD OF OBEYING MAINTAIN OF THE SEATED HAD TAKEN AND GROWLED
1320-122617-0022  THE DELAWARES CHILDREN OF THE TORTOISE IN THE OUTSTRIPPED THE DEER
1320-122617-0027  AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS
1320-122617-0029  IF YOU ARE NOT THEN KNOCKED ON THE HEAD YOUR BEING A NONCOMPOSSARABLE PROTECT YOU AND YOU'LL THEN HAVE A GOOD REASON TO EXPECT TO DIE IN YOUR BED
1320-122617-0033  IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SCALP AND I TRUST AND BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND ON IT UNCAS AND I WILL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT HAS BECOMES TRUE WARRIORS AND TRUST YOU FRIENDS
1580-141083-0002  MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
1580-141083-0009  WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
1580-141083-0014  TO BEST MY BELIEF THEY WERE WILL UP
1580-141083-0038  I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THIS STARE AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
1580-141084-0000  IT WAS THE INDIAN WHOSE DARK SILHOUETTE APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON HIS BLIND
1580-141084-0004  OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS KNOCKING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTEOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS
1580-141084-0029  HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANISTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER
1995-1826-0000  THE DEBATE BETWEEN SENIOR SOCIETIES OUR DEFEND SAID THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM
1995-1826-0014  HARDEN SHE PAUSED
1995-1826-0017  THE MIGHTY A BIT OF POULTRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE
1995-1836-0001  AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AND ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SENATE
1995-1836-0002  WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE HIS OTHER MEN
1995-1837-0000  HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE HE IS AN ZARA'S MUST BE RUINED
1995-1837-0007  THEN A SUDDEN AT MIDDAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE LOUIS STEEL THE EARTH STEAMED
2094-142345-0011  DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY A FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WHILE SHAPEN LIGHTFOOTED
2094-142345-0019  COME THE WOOL FOR THE WIDOWS INDEED
2094-142345-0029  DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
2094-142345-0039  I'D STRONG ASSURANCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN FROM ANYTHING I HAVE DONE
2094-142345-0047  OYSER IS NOT AT HOME IS HE
2094-142345-0060  OH I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPITAL ORDER
2300-131720-0011  BUT WHAT IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARM HOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL
2300-131720-0031  ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE
2830-3979-0012  THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOR EVER
2830-3980-0025  BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
2830-3980-0036  WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST REIGNS THERE
2830-3980-0037  SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE READING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE THREE
2830-3980-0041  GRACE INVOLVES THE RUSSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0047  TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE INTO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY
2830-3980-0073  THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION OF SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES INTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
2961-960-0001  THE INFLUENCE WHICH THAT TIMAS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
2961-960-0004  THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TENA'S FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEO PLATINISTS
2961-960-0011  WITH HER RELATUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE AN EXAGGERIST HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMANCE OF MINE ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PITHEGORY IS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF A WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
2961-960-0018  IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
2961-961-0006  AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF POET SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK
2961-961-0015  MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME
3570-5694-0008  THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
3570-5695-0001  INDEPENDENT TO US HAS DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN A LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PEASANTS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST
3570-5696-0002  ARE THE SAME STANDS PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PRACTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
3570-5696-0006  AS EUSTON SPEECH OF EVERY DAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRECATION
3570-5696-0008  BUT IT IS OTHER GROUNDS WITH NOTING THAT THE TIME WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERY DAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED THUS WASTEFUL
3570-5696-0009  INSPECT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE AT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN AMIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON
3575-170457-0015  I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I DISPARAGE THE GIFT WHICH YOU POSSESS NOR THAT I WOULD DISCOURAGE YOU FROM EXERCISING IT I ONLY EXHORT YOU SO TO THINK OF IT AND SO TO USE IT AS TO RENDER IT CONDUCIVE TO YOUR OWN PERMANENT GOOD
3575-170457-0023  I CAREFULLY AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PREOCCUPATION AND ACCENTRICITY WHICH MIGHT LEAD THOSE I LIVE AMONGST TO SUSPECT THE NATURE OF MY PURSUITS
3575-170457-0034  IN THIS MONOTONOUS LIFE OF MIND THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
3729-6852-0010  I NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY
3729-6852-0022  I ADDRESS HIM IN ITALIAN AND HE ANSWERS VERY WITTILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
3729-6852-0023  MARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVE TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT WRITER
3729-6852-0040  DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU WILL MAKE RAPID PROGRESS
4077-13751-0001  ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AND INSIGNIFICANT SEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITION
4077-13754-0010  IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS ENACTED WITH A PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING POOR MARRIAGE AND AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SENATE PRAYER TO ITS PASSAGE IT LAY FOR MANY YEARS A DEAD LETTER
4446-2273-0002  LAMB WOULDN'T CARE A GREAT DEAL OUT MANY OF THEM I FANCY
4446-2273-0016  HER HAIR IS STILL LIKE FLAX AND HER BLUE EYES ARE JUST LIKE A BABY'S AND SHE HAS THE SAME THREE FRECKLES ON HER LITTLE NOSE AND TALKS ABOUT GOING BACK TO HER BANDOME AIR
4446-2273-0021  WHAT SHE WANTED FROM US WAS NEITHER OUR FLOWERS NOR OUR FRANKS BUT JUST OUR YOUTH
4446-2273-0022  BUT BOTH REMEMBERING WHAT THE WOMAN HAD SAID WHEN SHE TOOK THE MONEY GOD GIVE YOU A HAPPY LOVE
4446-2275-0007  SHE PUSHED HIM FORWARD THE BIG CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEARTH HER KNEES DRAWN UP TO HER CHIN LAUGHING LIKE A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL
4446-2275-0031  I UNDERSTAND PARTLY I WAS WRONG
4507-16021-0042  IT IS BLACK AND MISFORTUNE IT IS BLACKER STILL IN CRIME THESE TWO BLACKNESSES AMALGAMATED COMPOSLANG
4507-16021-0047  YESTERDAY YOU WERE TREMBLING FOR A HEALTH THAT IS DEAR TO YOU TO DAY YOU FEAR FOR YOUR OWN TO MORROW IT WILL BE ANXIETY ABOUT MONEY THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE DIETRIBE OF A SLANDERER THE DAY AFTER THAT THE MISFORTUNE OF SOME FRIEND THEN THE PREVAILING WEATHER THEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN OR LOST THEN A PLEASURE WITH WHICH YOUR CONSCIENCE AND YOUR VERTERBRAL COLUMN REPROACH YOU AGAIN THE COURSE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
4970-29095-0028  HE DOESN'T SAY IT'S ON THE FRONTIER AND ON THE MAP EVERYTHING BEYOND IT IS MARKED INDIANS AND DESERT AND LOOKS AS DESOLATE AS A WEDSAY MEETING IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO DO SOMETHING
4992-41797-0003  MISTER POPHAM LAID DOWN HIS BREACH
4992-41797-0014  WHEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE A RABBIT OR A BIRD LOOK REAL ON PAPER SHE SEARCHED IN HER FATHER'S BOOKS FOR PICTURES OF ITS BONES
4992-41806-0004  BURN FIRE BURN FLICKER FLICKER FLAME
5105-28233-0006  NO CATHEDRAL NOT EVEN BURGOS ITSELF COULD VIE WITH THE CHURCH AT MOUNT MARCHER
5105-28241-0000  HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE EXCELLENT AND WOULD HAVE AMPLY SUFFICED FOR A CIRCUMVAGATION OF THE GLOBE
5105-28241-0005  FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED A LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST OF ALGERIA BUT NO LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH
5105-28241-0009  AND WHAT DEMONSTRATION DO YOU OFFER ASKED SERVADAC EAGERLY THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN
5105-28241-0010  OCEAN RAINED SUPREME
5142-36586-0000  IT IS MANIFEST THAT MAN IS NOW SUBJECT TO MUCH VARIABILITY
5639-40744-0012  SHE SUCCEEDED IN OPENING THE WINDOW AND THE MOONLIGHT SHONE IN SO BRIGHTLY AS SHE COULD DISTINGUISH THE COLOUR OF SOME DAMASK HANGING IN THE ROOM
5639-40744-0020  A STUDIUM INVITE MINDED FATHER COMFORT HIS UNHAPPY DAUGHTER AND HER MOTHER EMBRACING HER AGAIN DID ALL SHE COULD TO SOOTHE THE FEELINGS
5639-40744-0033  BEARING WAS GRACEFUL AND ANIMATED SHE LED HER SON BY THE HAND AND BEFORE HER WALKED TWO MAIDS WITH WAX LIGHTS AND SILVER CANDLESTICKS
5683-32865-0005  BUT AGREEING TO CAPTAIN LAKE WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE
5683-32865-0013  DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HE'LL SOON TIRE OF COUNTRY LIFE
5683-32879-0000  IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PAST ELEVEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PONY CARRIAGE FROM BRANDON DREW UP BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN WICKET OF REDAMING'S FARM
5683-32879-0009  ILL AND TROUBLED DEAR TROUBLED IN MIND AND MISERABLY NERVOUS
5683-32879-0016  AND THE WANT ORACLE HAVING SPOKEN SHE SAT DOWN IN THE SAME SORT OF ABSTRACTION AGAIN BESIDE DORCAS AND SHE LOOKED FULL IN HER COUSIN'S EYES
5683-32879-0019  I HAVE VERY FEW TO LOVE ME NOW AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LOVE ME AS I HAVE BEGUN TO LOVE YOU
5683-32879-0021 RCAS IN HER STRANGE WAY WAS MOVED
6829-68769-0001  IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM IN THE STATE'S PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
6829-68769-0006  IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORT CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
6829-68771-0013  INTENDANCE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FOR SEEING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR FIGHT
6829-68771-0019  SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MATE THAT ELMHURST A PLAIN BLACK GALE WITH A WHITE APRON AND CAP
6930-75918-0016  YES I NEED OPPOSE MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TO DAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURN TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN
6930-76324-0000  GOLIATH MAKES ANOTHER DISSEVERY

6930-81414-0026  MY OVERWROUGHT NERVES YIELDED AT LAST
7021-79740-0000  TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INTERRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
7021-79740-0001  A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
7021-79759-0002  THEIR CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
7021-85628-0009  AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROBES
7021-85628-0018  AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
7021-85628-0026  NO MY LITTLE FUN SHE SAID

8463-294828-0006  FROM RUBBING SHELTERS WITH SCIENTISTS AND OUR LITTLE UNIVERSE BY THE BATANICAL GARDENS THE BOY HAD COME TO KNOW A THING OR TWO
8463-294828-0013  HE WAS A FANATIC UNFORMALITY AND HE ONLY ADDRESSED ME IN THE THIRD PERSON TO THE POINT WHERE IT GOT HIGHER

4992-41797-0008  MISTER POPHAM EXAGGERATED NOTHING BUT ON THE CONTRARY LEFT MUCH UNSAID IN HIS NARRATIVE OF THE FAMILY AT THE HOUSE OF LORDS
